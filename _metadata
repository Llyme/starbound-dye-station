  "description" : "Adds a single dye that can change to 4, 294, 967, 296 colors. It should work with all mods as it only recolors armors. The mod relies heavily on the 'colorOptions' data for the raw image, but that shouldn't be a problem since all the armors have it. \n\nThe dye station can be crafted in a max level 'Inventor's Table' (recipe in the pictures). You'll need at least 1 empty bottle and 200 pixels to get the dye you want. \n\nTo pick a color, you'll need some knowledge about RGB color models. I recommend using an image editor (photoshop, paint.net, etc.) to get the color you want. Make sure you put the 'Empty Bottle' in the slot of the 'Dye Station' and press the button with the rainbow water drop thingy. The dye should be in your inventory.\n\nRGBA = Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (Transparency; 0 = Transparent; 255 = Opaque)\nHSV = Hue, Saturation, Value/Brightness\n\nBesides ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) NSFW reasons, you can make use of the transluency with Slime Race Mod! It makes you look gooey and I like slimes.\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=866175420] [img] https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/85969930484928181/CDC083F061B4B6E9D8196AC74A186CEC9A7EAFE1/ [/img] [/url]\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nItem ID\nDye Station = dyestation\nDye = superdye\n\nDoes this work with mods?\nYes, assuming your armor works with normal dyes.\n\nDoes this work with mods that adds NO armor?\nYes.\n\nWith the addition of transparency, do the previous dyes still work?\nYes.\n\nWhy does the protectorate's armor's logo disappear when I dye it?\nIt's because the logo is also part of the 'colorOptions' attribute (this is probably because of the yellow dye, since the logo's color is yellow).\n\nDo the vanilla dyes (Starbound's default dyes) disappear when I install this mod?\nNo.\n\nDo I keep the colors after I remove the mod?\nYes, because it changes the directives of the items directly (you can do this via admin commands).\n\nCan other players see my custom colored armor?\nYes.\n\nCan other players see the dye station?\nNo, as it crashes the game after they visit the same planet/ship with the dye station (Credits for Hieru for [url=http://shrani.si/f/1t/DL/3MoUJSJW/goo.png]testing[/url]).\n\nIs this server-sided or client sided?\nClient-sided. Both players must have the mod, otherwise the player without the mod will crash (you can still see custom colors though).\n\nDoes this work with old characters?\nYes, so long as your character is as old as when Starbound released the vanilla dyes.\n\nCan I recolor vanilla and mod weapons?\nNo.\n\nDoes the dye station and the custom dyes disappear after I remove the mod?\nI have no idea about the dye station if it was left placed on a surface, but if it's inside your inventory, it will turn into a green block (Perfectly Generic Item). Same thing happens to your custom dyes.",
